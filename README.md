# Minimal DiNO impl in PyTorch

This is a minimal version of the DiNO feature extractor for use in my projects.

This code is copied over from the DiNO baselines made available by the [Neural feature fusion fields repo](https://github.com/dichotomies/N3F/blob/master/feature_extractor/extract.py).

## Install requirements

### Install pytorch

First, install a recent pytorch release by following instructions on [https://pytorch.org/](https://pytorch.org/)


### Build package

Build the `dinofeat` package by running
